Summer is coming to an end and I was wondering how much time I invested this summer in cooking. I am excited about the food that I missed for an entire year after coming to US but in this summer I got lucky. It was a new country even in terms of food. It took some time before I could identify the stores that sell things I need, way of bringing those things home without a car in US and finally to be able to cook with the limited supply of utensils and time. Finally, so summer was the time when everything changed. There was a change in house and the company, there was change in the living condition and there were more money. My life pace became somewhat slow and I could expect to see the sun all days. Yes, being a gujju I am a big foodie even though I may not accept it right away. I do miss a lot of food especially "ghar ka khana" (homemade food) as well as apna chat. So here I want to note down the list of food items I relished and some other people also got a taste of it. Bhakri, Khicha papad, Bhel with amli n fudina chatni, nice aloo paratha, pav bhaji, samosa, coconut cutney, khaman, palak na muthiya, spagetti, bataka ane sabudana ni katri.... All these desi food might be just like a drop in the ocean but for me I hope it satiates my palate for the coming fall and winter. I am about to start my second roller-coaster ride this fall and its a long commitment until next August.
